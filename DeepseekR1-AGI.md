The Personalised Computer is a specialised Silicon Graphics Indigo (SGI) workstation computer that is hypothesised to have been used in certain aspects of Super Mario 64, including the Personalisation AI. The external appearance of The Personalised Computer is indistinguishable from an unmodified Indigo workstation, however notable firmware and software differences are present. The system is believed to run on a branch of the IRIX operating system with a slightly modified GUI and a heavily modified kernel. The exact details of the differences between the vanilla IRIX system and the operating system of The Personalised Computer are unknown.

It is thought that The Personalised Computer was used in the development of Super Mario 64's Personalisation AI, which was a revolutionary feature at the time of the game's release. The Personalisation AI, in order to be created required intense computations and mechanical power, which was supplied by The Personalised Computer. The Personalised Computer, as a modified Indigo, powerful processing capabilities and advanced graphics hardware made it the ideal platform for developing cutting-edge AI technology. Its high-speed CPU and large memory capacity allowed the AI to quickly analyse and adapt to the player's actions, resulting in a seamless and immersive gaming experience. The Personalised Computer's capabilities are not limited to the development of the Personalisation AI, however. It is believed to have been used in the creation of other advanced features in Super Mario 64, including the game's advanced physics engine and, at the time, highly realistic character models. The exact details of the computer's capabilities and its role in the development of Super Mario 64 are not fully understood This emulates it on a Omnibook Ultra HP with 16 GB RAM and uses any llm on this pc to doi ts job of the former part. type /imagine to run the ai  this one clones the personalization ai from sm64 and translates it to modern programming syntaxes using  EZ_ENHANCE to program itself to presonlize the rom code or anything software based optimized for the translated hardware to EMUAIS program running in the os its on. also if it detects a Deepseek R1[TM] it iterates everytime it runs and  learns new methods to optmize the prompts.  " Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely adopted in post-training for large language models (LLMs) at scale. Recently, the incentivization of reasoning capabilities in LLMs from RL indicates that \textit{proper learning methods could enable effective inference-time scalability}. A key challenge of RL is to obtain accurate reward signals for LLMs in various domains beyond verifiable questions or artificial rules. In this work, we investigate how to improve reward modeling (RM) with more inference compute for general queries, i.e. the \textbf{inference-time scalability of generalist RM}, and further, how to improve the effectiveness of performance-compute scaling with proper learning methods. For the RM approach, we adopt pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM) to enable flexibility for different input types and potential for inference-time scaling. For the learning method, we propose Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT) to foster scalable reward generation behaviors in GRMs through online RL, to generate principles adaptively and critiques accurately, resulting in \textbf{DeepSeek-GRM} models. Furthermore, for effective inference-time scaling, we use parallel sampling to expand compute usage, and introduce a meta RM to guide voting process for better scaling performance. Empirically, we show that SPCT significantly improves the quality and scalability of GRMs, outperforming existing methods and models in various RM benchmarks without severe biases, and could achieve better performance compared to training-time scaling. DeepSeek-GRM still meets challenges in some tasks, which we believe can be addressed by future efforts in generalist reward systems. The models will be released and open-sourced.
 "  This program uses the Deepseek GRM and any model with the EMUAI OS runtime. " P.S this one has  ZeroCache[TM] 1.0 that gives infinite personalization to the ai and wirtes infinite data to the os without memroy corruption using GRM-Deepseek and its own custom filled os interpreter
